# Literature Review

## Background

I began this Research Project by considering a few ideas.

One was to use the R Programming Language for some statistical computation.

Another was to try to combine R with another programming language.

The first idea here was to try to incorporate Java with R.

I started learning Java last semester and R this semester.

There is some documentation for combining Java and R.

However, after a recommendation by two different lecturers, one in Political Science and the other my Module Director Dr. James Sweeney, I decided to use RShiny.

The first step in the process was downloading and installing R.

The next step was to get RStudio running, for which I was grateful for Dr. Sweeney for answering questions I had in this regard.

Then I got RShiny running.

### RShiny

#### Software Framework

RShiny is a frontend framework for presenting analysis done using R visually in a webpage.

## Progress (Continued)

For RShiny I completed at least 2 introductory tutorials.

The first allowed for a Web App to run from a single file.

The second allowed for two files to run the website, an app.r file and a server.r file.

There was a step to use RServer, which I made some inroads into also.
