# Update R and R Studio

## Content

____

### If you want to update R and RStudio:

One way is to run the actual R program. 

There, you can go to the “R” menu and click “Check for R Updates” (see image below). 

If you do that, R will tell you the current version you’re on, 

and whether or not there is a more updated version that you can download (circled in blue).
